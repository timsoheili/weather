Weather Map based on Zip Code

Imagine you are not in WordPress, using HTML and CSS generate a template that looks similar to the image attached. You have free reign over anything else that is on the page layout but a recreation of that template must be in the layout somewhere.

In the layout you must also include an input in which a user can type in their zip code. Then based on that zip code, use the api here: https://openweathermap.org/api and display the results in the template that you created.

Once completed, describe in what tools/plugins you would use in WordPress to accomplish the same task and/or given the external files, how you would translate that into WordPress as is.
